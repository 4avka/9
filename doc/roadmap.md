# Parallelcoin Roadmap
## History

- [Original creation of coin by Parallaxis](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=721170.msg8145710#msg8145710), release 8 February 2014
- [Community Takeover Announcement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1097017) 23 June 2015
- Loki Verloren [formally started working on a new server](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1097017.msg39670320#msg39670320) 8 June 2018 based on btcsuite's [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd)

## Present

- **Plan 9 from Crypto Space** is nearing completion as the final stages of properly knitting the components is being completed and the interface and testing phase begins
    
    The core goal of this phase of development is to institute a new consensus that better distributes the tokens, both in moving to a constant growth rate over time and better peg to the clock, and reduction of the influence of large adversaries against the userbase and developers.
    
    The server has been rebuilt out of components used in Conformal's [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd) and [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) and associated utility libraries, the configuration and launch systems completely rewritten with the use cases in mind instead of oft-parroted but incomplete 'best practices'.

- **Rebalancing the Mining Equation** - The proof of work that will come into effect once the hard fork is settled and height of activation is announced is designed to be as difficult as possible to accelerate, in the hope that for this phase of development, the pernicious influence of profit-taking but non-interested parties such as mining pools, botnets and other types of mining-based exploits.
    
    It is not just a complex proof, however, we then went from 2 to 9 differenntly calculated proofs, and we add this further variation and set defaults for miners to be able to chase early blocks or help tighten the precision of the network clock (the latter is default). The proofs are all taxing of different aspects of the architecture and as a whole compound the ways in which timing can be affected are mitigated by probability and complex inter-relation between the 9 different algorithms.
    
- **Early concepts for the next phase of development** have started to coalesce. The central idea is creating a network of nodes who constantly report their subjective view of events on the network, and each node then attempts to reconcile the reports together and establish a global total ordering of events.

    It only takes a surprisingly small number of nodes reporting their first seeing of events (transactions) to create a graph of such complexity that even with all nodes byzantine but not spewing 100% easy to spot nonsense still all tell enough true facts about network chatter that with enough such nodes eventually consensus of the total order is computable.
    
## Future

- **Reverse Lightning** is the current provisional code name for the development of a distributed network protocol based on these early concepts.

    - A consensus based on an attempt to be recognised by peers as having been the first publisher of some given new pieece of information. This favours local peers validating local transactions, which is a strong counter-centralisation tendency.
    - Proof of sequence is generated by the network by unrestricted epidemic relay of every new message circulating on the network, by the publication of a signature on a document alongside a snapshot of the node's receiving queue's most recent 9 or so transaction/message hashes that precede it.
    - The nodes both relay first the message and then, for the case of a protocol transaction, attempt to sign and publish with their buffer snapshot, and then send this out to the network. **The economic incentive is that first publisher thereby issues some amount of the currency, a coinbase.**
    - Eventually every node stops finding nodes who haven't seen a message. As each message matures to total distribution, there is many (potentially geometrically expanding) attempts to be recorded as the first publisher of a transaction. 

> *Note that this isn't as trivial as it might sound*. 
> If you picture a small local area network with nodes nearby, within two hops, each one will be working at the same time, may have other things interfering (network packet loss, network attack attempts, congestion, etc) it is not guaranteed at all which message will cover the network first and slot into the #1 position.
