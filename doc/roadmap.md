## Present

4. **Plan 9 from Crypto Space** is nearing completion as the final stages of properly knitting the components is being completed and the interface and testing phase begins
    
    The core goal of this phase of development is to institute a new consensus that better distributes the tokens, both in moving to a constant growth rate over time and better peg to the clock, and reduction of the influence of large adversaries against the userbase and developers.
