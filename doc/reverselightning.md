# Multi-Token Protocols and Mining
### Flip Lightning on its head!

Many cryptocurrencies sport multiple and user-issuable arbitrary tokens, such as Ethereum ERC20 tokens, Bitshares tokens, and others. These chains execute transactions faster, on average, than Lightning clears a cross-chain atomic swap. 

However, their own architecture complicates a complete emulation of the supply parameters and compatibility of the script engine that validates transactions. Centralised and permissioned, especially geographically and network-distance constrained distributed databases could provide the millisecond speed required to sufficiently allow a complete simulation of the timing properties and supply of new tokens in a multi-token network protocol.

If a small chain with scarce resources and only a handful of developers wants to improve thteir chances of making a mark on the marketplace, the most important thing is access to the market.

If another network were able to host a functionally identical (but with instant clearance) network but bit for bit compatible blocks and transactions alongside its own native base token, it would be trivial to implement instant clearing cross-chain transactions, aka Atomic Swaps.

For the small chains, beset on all sides by ASIC makers, pump and dumpers, predatory pool miners and opportunistic large mining farms (such as Nicehash), the combination of all these threats, plus thin connections to the marketplace compound the early stage development process.

However, if a consortium of similarly afflicted small projects were to be able to merge their tokens together in a multi-token protocol with on-chain exchange and sub-second clearance to finality, firstly between themselves they can easily shift tokens, taking advantage of differences in markets or geofenced access (by network or by fiat) - then they would ultimately eventually sell very easily the idea of all cryptocurrencies moving to a single base protocol.

### How to do it???!

Obviously, with current consensus protocols based on PoW, staking, and weakly synchronous, a ledger's latency will only increase with more transactions.

Both approaches trade off things that have a similar end result - the development of a main miner group numbering around 20. Whether it is Delegated Proof of Stake, Proof of Stake (like Pivx) or Hashcash Proof of Work, the numbers we see in the top 95% of blocks mined by only a score of miners.
