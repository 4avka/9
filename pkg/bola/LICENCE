Anti Establishment Licence

Out here we pay no heed to such oxymoronic concepts as intellectual property, so
for us this is a joke. But for those who think all but a death sentence is 
earned by violating copyright, or some approximation of such, the following 
terms are binding:

No government organisation, contractor or any private company that has a policy 
of the 'codes of conduct' in their internal or external social network 
connections that designate any kind of expression as expulsion- worthy and even 
persecuting- worthy offence may make direct use of this code in their software 
development pipeline. This would now include the Linux foundation and several 
other formerly open free speech permitting 'open source' software organisations.

On the other side, however, this licence may include any other code designated
as free to redistribute, and as a matter of politeness, leave in the code's
licences as required. If the licence effectively allows reuse to re-licence it,
then this licence will cover such novated code.

This licence does not cover documentation or comments, because those are mostly 
worthless if they are no good anyway, and do not implement anything.
