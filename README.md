Parallelcoin all-in-one next generation server application suite.

## what is parallelcoin?

Parallelcoin is an altcoin that appeared around the time of the MtGox hack and the first appearance of ASIC miners on the market.

The original creator of the token shortly afterwards disappeared again, and hasn't been seen since.

It was shortly afterwards adopted and after some time finally programmers were found to bring this old miner-focused coin into the next generation.

### roadmap

#### where we've been

1. Original creation of coin by Parallaxis, release 8 February 2014
2. Community Takeover Announcement https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1097017 23 June 2015
3. Loki Verloren started working on a new server 20 May 2018

#### where we're going

## plan 9 from crypto space!

We are very proud of the work so far and we think that people will love the new Parallelcoin:

- 9 complex multi-algorithm orthogonal complexity proof of work hash functions
    - cryptonote 7 v2 for cache-heavy hashesh
    - 
- 4 part averaging algorithm:
    - All time average - to prevent long term drift
    - One day trailing simple average
    - Per-block exponential weighted average
    - Per-algorithm equal spacing averaging with exponential weighted average
- strong resistance to timing and rhythm attacks by the use of multiple competing averagers 
    - no hard limiters
    - tends towards equilibrium
- default odds-following weighted randomising work schedulers
    - miners bias timing to the inner 2SD (9-27 seconds)
- 9 second blocks with difficulty reduction damper to reduce coincidence of very short intervals between blocks
    - increases warmup cost of specialised miners with a shorter average time between blocks
    - decreases window of opportunity for pool miners via their inherent high latency, and the same for botnets
    - short time between blocks tends to favour miners nearer to the origin of  the transaction - instead of going to the cheapest surplus electricity
    - more practical for face to face transactions due to shorter clearance time, without any additional systems overlaying it

4. Release of Plan 9 from Crypto Space software suite, mid April 2019
5. Hard Fork scheduled for ~ block 199999 ~ May 2019
6. 3 months intensive monitoring and bug-catching until end of July
7. Begin intensive work towards implementing the Distributed Journal Cache Protocol with its Proof of Causality logical clocks and probabalistic graph analysis, first working beta by January 2020
8. Migrate DUO ledger to DJCP and beging work on messaging/microblogging/blogging/publishing applications, and distributed application platform.
